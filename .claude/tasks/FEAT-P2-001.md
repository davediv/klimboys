- **Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ High Priority

## Implementation Status
- **Status**: âœ… Completed
- **Completion Date**: 2025-08-24
- **Time Taken**: Medium effort as estimated

## Changes Made

### Files Created
None - Product page was already created in UI-P2-003 as a basic scaffold

### Key Implementation Details
1. **Product List View**:
   - Table layout with product image/icon
   - Shows name, description, category
   - Displays all variants with pricing
   - Stock quantities with visual indicators (red < 10, yellow < 20, green â‰¥ 20)
   - Active/inactive status badge

2. **Search and Filter**:
   - Real-time search by product name or category
   - Debounced search input with icon

3. **Add Product Modal**:
   - Form fields for name, description, category
   - Category dropdown with predefined options
   - Variant management for Regular and Large sizes
   - Volume in ml per variant
   - Cost and selling price inputs
   - Initial stock quantity
   - TODO comments for API integration

4. **Edit Product Modal**:
   - Same form as Add but pre-populated
   - Preserves existing product data
   - Updates product in local state
   - TODO comments for API integration

5. **Delete Product Modal**:
   - Confirmation dialog with warning
   - Shows product name being deleted
   - Removes from local state
   - TODO comments for API integration

6. **Product Actions**:
   - Edit button opens edit modal
   - Delete button opens confirmation
   - Status toggle switches active/inactive
   - All actions update local state

## Testing Summary

### Check Code Testing
- [x] svelte-check for TypeScript (`npm run check`) - Passed with accessibility warnings
- [x] Check code with Prettier and ESLint (`npm run lint`) - Passed
- [x] Auto-format code with Prettier (`npm run format`) - Applied
- [x] Check build error (`npm run build`) - Successful build

### Automated Tests
No automated tests added (will be covered in TEST-P3 phase)

### Manual Testing
- Product list displays correctly with mock data
- Search filters products in real-time
- Add modal opens and accepts input
- Edit modal pre-fills data correctly
- Delete modal shows confirmation
- All modals can be closed via Cancel or backdrop click
- Stock indicators show correct colors
- Status toggle updates visually

## Technical Debt & Notes

### TODO Items
- Connect to API endpoints when available (API-P2-001 through API-P2-004)
- Add image upload functionality (FEAT-P2-003)
- Implement actual data persistence
- Add form validation for required fields
- Add loading states during API calls

### Refactor Opportunities
- Extract modal components for reusability
- Create a shared form component for add/edit
- Implement proper TypeScript types instead of `any`
- Fix accessibility warnings for form labels

### Performance Considerations
- Currently using local state with mock data
- Will need pagination when connected to real API
- Consider virtual scrolling for large product lists

### Security Notes
- Input validation needed before API integration
- Sanitize HTML in product descriptions
- Validate price inputs to prevent negative values

## Version Control
- **Commit Hash**: Will be added after commit
- **Branch**: main
- **PR Number**: N/A (direct commit)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Task
- **Recommended**: `API-P2-001` - Implement GET /api/products endpoint
  - Required to connect the UI to real data
  - Will replace mock data with database queries
  - Enables search and filtering on backend

### Alternative Tasks
- **Alternative 1**: `FEAT-P2-002` - Create product add/edit modal with form
  - Already partially implemented, needs API connection
- **Alternative 2**: `FEAT-P2-005` - Create transaction page layout
  - Another UI task that can proceed independently

### Related Documentation Updates Needed
- [ ] Document product management workflow
- [ ] Add admin user guide for product management
- [ ] Update API documentation once endpoints are created

## Quality Checklist
- [x] All acceptance criteria are met
  - [x] Products list view with search/filter
  - [x] Add product button (functional with modal)
  - [x] Edit/delete actions per product
- [x] Code follows project conventions (Svelte 5 runes, DaisyUI)
- [x] Appropriate code checks passed
- [x] No critical errors or warnings
- [x] Performance impact is acceptable
- [x] Security considerations noted for future
- [x] TODO.md updated correctly

**Notes**: The product management page is fully functional with local state management. Once the API endpoints are implemented (API-P2-001 through API-P2-004), the page can be connected to the backend for data persistence. The UI provides a complete admin experience for managing products with all CRUD operations available.
