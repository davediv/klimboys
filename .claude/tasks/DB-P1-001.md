# Task Implementation Report

## Task Details

- **ID**: `DB-P1-001`
- **Description**: Create products table schema with Drizzle ORM
- **Category**: DB (Database)
- **Phase**: P1
- **Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical/Blocker

## Implementation Status

- **Status**: âœ… Completed
- **Completion Date**: 2025-08-24
- **Time Taken**: Small effort as estimated

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

- `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts` - Added products table schema definition

### Key Implementation Details

- Created products table with all required fields:
  - `id`: Primary key with UUID auto-generation
  - `name`: Product name (required)
  - `description`: Product description (optional)
  - `category`: Product category (required)
  - `imageUrl`: URL for product image stored in R2 (optional)
  - `isActive`: Boolean flag for soft delete functionality
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp with automatic Unix epoch default
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp with automatic update on modification
- Followed existing schema patterns from auth tables
- Used Drizzle ORM SQLite syntax appropriate for Cloudflare D1
- Implemented automatic timestamp handling with SQL functions

## Testing Summary

### Check Code Testing

- [x] svelte-check for TypeScript (`npm run check`) - âœ… Passed
- [x] Check code with Prettier and ESLint (`npm run lint`) - âœ… Fixed formatting
- [x] Auto-format code with Prettier (`npm run format`) - âœ… Applied
- [x] Check build error (`npm run build`) - âœ… Build successful

### Automated Tests

- **Added**: 0 tests (no test framework setup yet)
- **Coverage**: N/A

## Technical Debt & Notes

- **TODO**: Need to generate and run migrations after all schema tables are created
- **Refactor Opportunities**: None at this time
- **Performance Considerations**: Indexes may be needed on `category` and `isActive` fields after usage patterns are established
- **Security Notes**: No sensitive data in this table

## Version Control

- **Commit Hash**: Not committed yet (waiting for batch of schema changes)
- **Branch**: main
- **PR Number**: N/A

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Task

- **Recommended**: `DB-P1-002` - Create product_variants table schema
  - This is the logical next step as it depends on DB-P1-001 and is needed for product pricing
  - Will establish foreign key relationship to products table

### Alternative

- **Alternative**: `DB-P1-003` - Create transactions table schema
  - Could be done in parallel as it doesn't depend on product_variants

### Related Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] Will need to update API documentation when endpoints are created
- [ ] Database schema diagram should be created after all tables are defined
