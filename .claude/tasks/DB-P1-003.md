# Task Implementation Report

## Task Details

- **ID**: `DB-P1-003`
- **Description**: Create transactions table schema
- **Category**: DB (Database)
- **Phase**: P1
- **Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical/Blocker

## Implementation Status

- **Status**: âœ… Completed
- **Completion Date**: 2025-08-24
- **Time Taken**: Small effort as estimated

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

- `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts` - Added transactions table schema definition

### Key Implementation Details

- Created transactions table with all required fields:
  - `id`: Primary key with UUID auto-generation
  - `transactionCode`: Unique transaction code (format: TRX-YYYYMMDD-XXXX)
  - `userId`: Foreign key reference to user table (cashier/admin who processed)
  - `channel`: Sales channel (Store, GrabFood, GoFood, ShopeeFood, UberEats)
  - `paymentMethod`: Payment type (Cash, QRIS, Transfer, etc.)
  - `subtotal`: Original amount before discounts (stored as cents)
  - `discount`: Discount amount (stored as cents, default 0)
  - `total`: Final amount after discounts (stored as cents)
  - `notes`: Optional transaction notes
  - `status`: Transaction status with default 'completed' (pending/completed/cancelled/refunded)
  - `createdAt` & `updatedAt`: Automatic timestamp management
- Used integer type for monetary values (stored as cents) to avoid decimal precision issues
- Added unique constraint on transaction_code field
- Included discount field for future promotional features
- Status field supports transaction lifecycle management

## Testing Summary

### Check Code Testing

- [x] svelte-check for TypeScript (`npm run check`) - âœ… Passed
- [x] Check code with Prettier and ESLint (`npm run lint`) - âœ… Fixed formatting
- [x] Auto-format code with Prettier (`npm run format`) - âœ… Applied
- [x] Check build error (`npm run build`) - âœ… Build successful

### Automated Tests

- **Added**: 0 tests (no test framework setup yet)
- **Coverage**: N/A

## Technical Debt & Notes

- **TODO**:
  - Need to generate and run migrations after all schema tables are created
  - Implement transaction code generation logic (TRX-YYYYMMDD-XXXX format)
- **Refactor Opportunities**: None at this time
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Index on `transactionCode` will be created by unique constraint
  - May need index on `createdAt` for date-based queries
  - Consider index on `userId` if filtering by cashier becomes common
- **Security Notes**:
  - All monetary values stored as integers (cents) to prevent calculation errors
  - Foreign key ensures only valid users can create transactions

## Version Control

- **Commit Hash**: To be committed with other schema changes
- **Branch**: main
- **PR Number**: N/A

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Task

- **Recommended**: `DB-P1-004` - Create transaction_items table schema
  - Now unblocked as it depends on DB-P1-002 (completed) and DB-P1-003 (just completed)
  - Essential for recording individual items in each transaction

### Alternative

- **Alternative**: `DB-P1-005` - Create inventory_logs table schema
  - Also unblocked (depends on DB-P1-002)
  - Could be done in parallel with transaction_items

### Related Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] API documentation for transaction endpoints (when created)
- [ ] Transaction code generation algorithm documentation
- [ ] Payment method and channel enum documentation
- [ ] Status transition flow documentation
