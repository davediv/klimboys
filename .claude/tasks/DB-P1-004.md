# Task: DB-P1-004 - Create transaction_items table schema

## Status: ✅ Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the transaction_items table schema in Drizzle ORM to store individual line items for each transaction in the POS system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Implementation

- **File**: `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts`
- **Added**: `transactionItems` table with the following fields:
  - `id`: UUID primary key with auto-generation
  - `transactionId`: Foreign key reference to transactions table with cascade delete
  - `productVariantId`: Foreign key reference to product_variants table
  - `quantity`: Integer for quantity of items
  - `unitPrice`: Integer stored as cents for precision
  - `totalPrice`: Integer stored as cents for precision

### 2. Key Design Decisions

- **Monetary Storage**: Continued pattern of using integers (cents) for all monetary values (unitPrice, totalPrice)
- **Foreign Keys**:
  - `transactionId` includes cascade delete to automatically remove line items when transaction is deleted
  - `productVariantId` references specific product size/variant
- **No Timestamps**: Line items don't need individual timestamps as they inherit from parent transaction
- **Primary Key**: Using UUID for consistency with other tables

### 3. Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript checks passed
- ✅ ESLint validation passed
- ✅ Prettier formatting applied
- ✅ Production build successful

## Technical Notes

- The table establishes the many-to-many relationship between transactions and product variants
- Each line item tracks the exact price at time of sale (important for price history)
- Quantity and pricing are denormalized for data integrity (prices may change over time)

## Dependencies Satisfied

- ✅ DB-P1-002 (product_variants table) - Referenced as foreign key
- ✅ DB-P1-003 (transactions table) - Referenced as foreign key with cascade delete

## Next Steps

- DB-P1-005: Create inventory_logs table schema
- DB-P1-006: Generate and run initial database migrations
