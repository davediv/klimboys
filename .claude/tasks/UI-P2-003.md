# Task: UI-P2-003 - Create role-based routing logic

## ✅ Task Completed

**Task**: UI-P2-003  
**Status**: Completed  
**Completion Date**: 2025-08-24

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented role-based routing logic with comprehensive access control throughout the application.

### Components Implemented

1. **Route Guards (`/src/lib/server/guards.ts`)**
   - Created reusable `routeGuard` function for role-based protection
   - Handles authentication, email verification, and role requirements
   - Automatic redirection based on user roles

2. **Login Page Enhancement (`/src/routes/login/+page.svelte`)**
   - Added role-based redirection after successful login
   - Admin users → Dashboard
   - Cashier users → Transaction page
   - Viewers → Homepage

3. **Protected Routes**
   - **Dashboard** (`/src/routes/dashboard/+page.server.ts`): Requires cashier role or higher
   - **Transaction** (`/src/routes/transaction/+page.svelte`): Cashier-only POS interface
   - **Admin Products** (`/src/routes/admin/products/+page.svelte`): Admin-only product management

4. **Dynamic Navigation (`/src/lib/components/Header.svelte`)**
   - Role-aware navigation menu
   - Shows appropriate links based on user role
   - User dropdown with role-specific options

5. **Layout Integration**
   - Created layout server load to pass user data
   - Header component receives user context
   - Consistent role checking across all pages

### Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Admin users redirected to dashboard after login**
- Login page checks user role and redirects admins to `/dashboard`

✅ **Cashier users redirected to transaction page**
- Cashiers are automatically redirected to `/transaction` for POS access

✅ **Unauthorized access prevented**
- Route guards prevent access to restricted pages
- Users without proper roles are redirected to appropriate pages
- Viewers cannot access admin or cashier areas

### Files Modified

- `/src/lib/server/guards.ts` - Created route guard utility
- `/src/routes/login/+page.svelte` - Enhanced with role-based redirection
- `/src/routes/dashboard/+page.server.ts` - Added role protection
- `/src/routes/transaction/+page.server.ts` - Created with cashier protection
- `/src/routes/transaction/+page.svelte` - Implemented POS interface
- `/src/routes/admin/products/+page.server.ts` - Created with admin protection
- `/src/routes/admin/products/+page.svelte` - Implemented product management UI
- `/src/lib/components/Header.svelte` - Enhanced with role-aware navigation
- `/src/routes/+layout.server.ts` - Created to pass user data
- `/src/routes/+layout.svelte` - Updated to pass user to Header

### Testing Notes

The implementation includes:
- Role hierarchy enforcement (admin > cashier > viewer)
- Email verification checks where required
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Responsive UI components for all user roles

### Next Steps

With role-based routing complete, the following dependent tasks can now proceed:
- `FEAT-P2-001` - Create product management page layout (admin only)
- Other admin and cashier-specific features

### Dependencies Resolved

- ✅ AUTH-P1-004 - `hasRole()` function already exists in auth.ts
- ✅ UI-P2-001 - Login page previously implemented
