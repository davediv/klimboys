# FEAT-P2-003: Implement R2 image upload functionality

## Task Status: ✅ COMPLETED

**Completed Date**: 2025-08-24

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented R2 image upload functionality for product images with both a general upload endpoint and product-specific image management.

## Components Created/Modified

### 1. API Endpoints

#### `/src/routes/api/upload/+server.ts`

- **Purpose**: General-purpose image upload endpoint
- **Features**:
  - Validates file type (JPEG, PNG, WebP only)
  - Enforces 5MB file size limit
  - Uploads to R2 bucket with unique filename using nanoid
  - Returns public URL for uploaded image
  - Includes DELETE handler for image removal

#### `/src/routes/api/products/[id]/image/+server.ts`

- **Purpose**: Product-specific image upload endpoint
- **Features**:
  - POST handler for uploading/updating product images
  - Automatically deletes old image when replacing
  - Updates product record with new image URL
  - DELETE handler for removing product images
  - Maintains referential integrity with product data

### 2. UI Components

#### `/src/routes/admin/products/+page.svelte`

- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Added image upload input to both Add and Edit modals
  - Real-time image preview functionality
  - Support for both file upload and URL input
  - File validation on client side (type and size)
  - Visual feedback during upload with loading states
  - Remove image functionality
  - Integrated with product creation/update workflow

### 3. Type Definitions

#### `/src/worker-configuration.d.ts`

- Generated Cloudflare Workers type definitions
- Added R2Bucket binding type for BUCKET

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Validation

- **Allowed Types**: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`
- **Max Size**: 5MB (5 _ 1024 _ 1024 bytes)
- Validation performed both client-side and server-side

### R2 Storage Structure

- Files stored with path: `products/{productId}-{nanoid}.{extension}`
- Public URL format: `https://pub-auto.r2.dev/{filename}`
- Includes metadata: uploadedBy, originalName, uploadedAt

### Security Features

- Admin role verification (using hasRole)
- Platform environment checks for R2 availability
- Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- File type and size validation

## Integration Points

1. **Product Creation Flow**:
   - Create product first via POST /api/products
   - Upload image to /api/products/{id}/image if file selected
   - Product creation succeeds even if image upload fails

2. **Product Update Flow**:
   - Upload new image if file selected
   - Update product data including new image URL
   - Old image automatically deleted when replaced

## Testing Performed

- ✅ TypeScript compilation (npm run check)
- ✅ ESLint validation (npm run lint)
- ✅ Code formatting (npm run format)
- ✅ Production build (npm run build)
- ✅ All checks passed with 0 errors

## Dependencies Satisfied

- **INFRA-P1-002**: R2 bucket configuration ✓
- **API-P2-002**: POST /api/products endpoint ✓

## Related Tasks Completed

- **API-P2-005**: POST /api/products/:id/image endpoint was implemented as part of this task

## Notes

- R2 public URL format may need adjustment based on actual Cloudflare configuration
- Currently using `pub-auto.r2.dev` domain; can be customized with custom domain
- Image deletion is handled gracefully - failures don't block other operations
- Accessibility warnings exist for form labels but don't affect functionality

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- [x] Accept image files (jpg, png, webp)
- [x] Upload to R2 bucket
- [x] Return public URL
- [x] Max file size 5MB
- [x] Integration with product management UI
